Description
This Python script retrieves user data from an API, combines it with order details, generates fictitious addresses based on city names, fetches weather information, and stores the final data in a SQL Server database.

Functionality Breakdown:
User Data Acquisition:

Parses user data from a specified API and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame.
Order Details Integration:

Merges the user data DataFrame with a separate DataFrame containing order details.
Fictitious Address Generation:

Creates a dictionary mapping city names to fictitious addresses.
Weather Data Retrieval:

Iterates through the combined DataFrame:
Attempts to fetch weather data for each user's address using a weather API.
If the address request fails (non-200 status code), uses the city name as a fallback for weather data retrieval.
Data Persistence:

Pushes the final DataFrame, containing user, order, address, and weather data, to a SQL Server database using the push_db class.
